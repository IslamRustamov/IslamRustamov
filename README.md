# Ahoj

I am a software engineer who works primarily (as of 03.01.2025) with React Native

I am absolutely not limited by JavaScript and React-ish environment, so I work/deal/have fun with lots of stuff

### Some of my social stuff

* [Medium](https://medium.com/@islamrustamov) - writing articles about different programming-related stuff
* [Itch](https://islamrustamov.itch.io/) - making videogames with GameMaker and Godot, you can play some stuff I made a while ago
* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/islamrustamov) - I sometimes stream how I make videogames so you might have a chance of catching me actually doing it
* [Twitter](https://x.com/SamGhost98) - posting my game development progress here
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/xaxQpqgg) - my personal discord server (which is nearly empty)

And I also participated in a Russian-wide conference as a speaker, you can check out my speech here:
